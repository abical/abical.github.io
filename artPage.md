### *Atychiphobia [fear of failure]* : Unity Project (2019)

Atychiphobia was Abigail's senior thesis at SAY Sí centered around the toxic view of failure she witnessed being perpetuated within the educational system. The game was built in Unity, programmed in C#, and uses the XBox Kinect for player tracking and mapping.

Atychiphobia [fear of failure] is based on the struggles I have experienced with the educational system. The expectations enforced by myself, my loved ones, and my community manifested themselves in intense dread in the face of failure or academic tribulations.
	The experience guides the player through thoughts and surreal imagery that embody emotions that feel bigger than the player themselves. Atychiphobia simulates brought about by crushing academic pressure. I hope that the application of these elements and digital environment in this piece will provoke the player and give them an abstract, empathetic look into the mind of a student in today’s educational system. 
	The fear of failure is something I see being perpetuated in today’s classrooms. I have grappled with the fear of failure throughout my academic career, not because of the subject matter of my learning but by the delivery and current structures of the educational system. The toxic mindsets are fed to the students of my generation.  By learning how to work and adapt to the current collegiate institution, I have managed to find my own path to success. Not all students, however, can tame the fear of failure enough to be able to find a future for themselves in academia.

### *Mother to Murderer (Mamá a la Asesina)* : La Llorona Zine (2018)

![mother to murderer presentation](https://github.com/abical/abical.github.io/blob/master/p%20image/presenting%20m2m%20resized.jpg?raw=true)

Mother to Murderer is a poetry zine which  explores the roots of La Llorona in a more literary depth. This self publication features a collection of original essays, poems, and cover.

<p> <br>


In many global cultures, weeping women serve as cautionary legends. Our local weeping legend, La Llorona, like the region of Texas itself, has witnessed the reign of many powers. Amongst the tides of cultural change that have spanned centuries, several homogenous tales have melded together to form the frightening woman we know today. My zine explores the elusive past of La Llorona, a woman who incites fear in the hearts of children, through poetry and a collection of short essays. 
<br>
To capture the possible origins of La Llorona respectfully, I compiled from past projects and current examinations from articles and interviews with locals and historians. Thanks to the joint efforts of myself and my peers, I came to express these findings through a combination of original artistic and historical literature. I wanted Mother to Murderer to gently lead its reader through the various faces that past cultures, such as the Coahuiltecan, Aztecs, and Spanish settlers, have attributed to La Llorona, and how those interpretations reflect the value of women and mothers during those eras of society. Whether it be the reverence of dead mothers or the condemnation of jealousy, La Llorona manifests the societal pondering of the border between life and death or sin and virtue.

### *Native Origins of La Llorona* : Lead Artist (2018)

*Native Origins of La Llorona* is an animatic, created with Adobe Premiere, which explores the local legend La Llorona and her origins. As lead artist of the project, Abigail guided her fellow SAY Sí artists in the research, writing, production, and installation of the animatic. 

![native origin screen cap](https://github.com/abical/abical.github.io/blob/master/p%20image/native%20origins%20screen%20cap.png?raw=true)

The project was stylistically inspired by the works of German artist [Lotte Reiniger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotte_Reiniger) and American silhouettist [Kara Walker](http://www.karawalkerstudio.com/). After conducting extensive research Abigail and her team found that the woman who haunts the nightmares of many San Antonio children had a plethora of potential origin stories.
