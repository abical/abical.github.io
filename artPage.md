## Abigail's Projects

### *Atychiphobia [fear of failure]* : Unity Project (2019)

Atychiphobia was my senior thesis at SAY Sí and an interactive installation based on the struggles I have experienced with the educational system. The expectations enforced by myself, my loved ones, and my community manifested themselves in intense dread in the face of failure or academic tribulations. The game was built in Unity, programmed in C#, and uses the XBox Kinect for player tracking and mapping.

### *Love Lies Here* : Video Game

[Love Lies Here](https://say-si.itch.io/love-lies-here) is a plot based adventure game programmed in Unity. Abigail participated as a project manager and contributed to the story and programming. The full videogame is available for purchase on [SAY Sí's itch.io](https://say-si.itch.io/).

Created in collaboration with Lee Ortiz, Sebastian Alvalos, Alyssa Li Herevia, and Ferris Carrillo for SAY Sí’s HIVE New Media 2018 Summer Game Jam.

### *Mother to Murderer* : La Llorona Zine

Mother to Murderer is a poetry zine which  explores the roots of La Llorona in a more literary depth. This self publication features a collection of original essays, poems, and cover.

### *Native Origins of La Llorona* : Lead Artist

Created in collaboration with SAY Sí artists: Nat Lopez Romero, Ava Keel, and Sarah Rodriguez for SAY Sí’s 2018 Story Seldom Told: Omitted Histories Gallery Installation. Origins of La Llorona is a premiere animation, exploring the local legend La Llorona and her origins. The project was stylistically inspired by German artist Lotte Reiniger and the works of American silhouettist Kara Walker. After conducting extensive research we found that the woman who haunts the nightmares of many San Antonio children had a plethora of potential origin stories. 

### *Goodnight Charlie* : Radio Drama

Goodnight Charlie is a radio drama created in Adobe Audition in collaboration with SAY Sí artist, Ella Wilson, for SAY Sí’s 2018 September Showcase. The full podcase episode is available to stream on [SAY Sí's SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-430523344/good-night-charlie).

The story follows ex government worker, Charlie, and his wife, Aspen, who are on the run from their previous lives and identities. After arriving at a desolate motel, Charlie is mysteriously confronted about his wife’s suspicious behaviors.
