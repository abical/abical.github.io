## Abigail's Research and Robotic Projects

### Soft Robotics Toolkit: Wearable Soft Robotics Gripper (2022-2023)
For Harvard's Biodesign Lab, I worked on the Soft Robotics Toolkit (SRT) Wearable Soft Robotics Gripper. My focus was to create a SRT that could expose users to the field of soft robotics through the concept of learning through making/ learning by playing. In this work, I learned a lot about educational, medical, and child friendly design as well as soft robotic fabrication techniques.

I presented my research at the Material Research Society’s Fall meeting in 2022 at their poster presentation session.

### Tesla Experience: Process, Dimensional, and Manufacturing Engineering (Spring & Summer 2023)


### Turf Wars Robot: GD&Tea (2022)

For Harvard's Computer Aided Design course, Abigail worked with a team of three other engineering students to design and manufacture a robot that can traverse ramps and transport ball-shaped gems to the field goals. (Project finished, documentation to follow)

### CHOPSTICKZ (2018)

As a part of the Engineering Design course at MITES, Abigail joined a team with three other MITES students 
to design and manufacture a robot to compete in a robotics competition on a flat field. 
Through their relentless work on CHOPSTICKZ, named after the robot's usage of two incisors, 
Abigail and her three teammates were awarded with the *MITES Engineering Design Teamwork Award*.

Abigail gained machining and re-iterative design experience through her work on the CHOPSTICKZ team.

### *SAWS Confluence Water Conference* : School Analysis (2017)

Abigail was a student leader for her highschool’s San Antonio Water System (SAWS) Confluence
Water Conference project. For the project, she led a team of fellow students in the collection and display 
of her school's water usage data. During the 2017 conference, she aided in presentation of her team's project.
